# Project Title: Timer Application

# Introduction:
Hello everyone, today I'm excited to present our Timer Application project. This application allows users to start and stop a timer, request camera and screenshot data, and retrieve a report from a server.

# Features:

Start Timer: Clicking the "Start" button initiates the timer.
Stop Timer: Clicking the "Stop" button halts the timer.
Request Camera and Screenshot Data: The application sends GET requests to localhost:3000/camera and localhost:3000/screenshot respectively every 10 minutes while the timer is running.
Retrieve Report: Clicking the "Get Report" button sends a GET request to localhost:3000/report and displays the response in a dedicated box.
# Code Overview:

* HTML Structure: The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Timer Functionality: JavaScript handles the timer functionality, updating the timer display every second and triggering additional actions every 10 minutes.
* Request Handling: Fetch API is used to send HTTP requests to the specified endpoints, handling both successful responses and errors.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, our Timer Application provides a simple yet effective tool for managing time and accessing data from external sources. Thank you for your attention, and we welcome any feedback or questions.
